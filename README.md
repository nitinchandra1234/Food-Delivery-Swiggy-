Analysis of Swiggy in Bangalore based on Data Scraped from the Website

--Introduction:
In today's digital age, data plays a crucial role as it enables companies to gather insights and make informed decisions. To collect and manage large amounts of data, companies often employ data scientists. This project focuses on extracting data from the Swiggy website (www.swiggy.com/) in Bangalore and performing exploratory data analysis to gain valuable insights.

--Steps Involved in the Process:

1.Data Extraction using Python Libraries:
The data extraction process involves using Python libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup. However, Swiggy's website is dynamic, requiring scrolling to the end of the page to retrieve more data. To overcome this, libraries like pyshadow and Selenium are utilized. By combining BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and pyshadow, the data is extracted in HTML format.

2.Data Cleaning:
Once the data is extracted, it undergoes a data cleaning process. Power Query is used to import the extracted data into Excel. Various data cleaning techniques are applied to ensure data integrity and consistency.

3.Data Exploration:
After cleaning the data, it is studied to uncover potential insights and clues that can assist in making business decisions. This step involves exploring the data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations.

4.Data Presentation:
The insights gained from the data exploration are presented visually using various charts and graphs. This aids in effectively communicating the findings to stakeholders and decision-makers.

5.Data Analysis:
The data analysis phase involves leveraging the cleaned and explored data to derive meaningful conclusions. Statistical techniques, data modeling, and machine learning algorithms may be employed to gain deeper insights and make data-driven decisions.

By following these steps, we were able to extract, clean, explore, and analyze Swiggy's data from their website in Bangalore. The resulting insights can provide valuable information for business decision-making and strategic planning.
